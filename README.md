Stract

Stract tries to make it simple to extract a range of bytes from a file and save it as a new file.

syntax: stract <inputfile> <outputfile> <firstbye> <lastbyte>

This program requires the program "dd" which should be preinstalled on any Unix or Linux system.
It should work in Windows if you have "dd" installed and in the path.
